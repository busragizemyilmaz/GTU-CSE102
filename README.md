# GTU CSE102 - Computer Programming

This repository contains solutions to the CSE102 Computer Programming assignments, studied during the 1st year (Spring semester) of Computer Engineering at Gebze Technical University (GTU).

### The course was structured as weekly assignments throughout 14 weeks:
- Each week, students were given a programming assignment. We had 1 week to complete and submit the solutions.
- For each assignment, we were required to attend a demo session where the instructors evaluated our code and its output before grading.

### Each folder includes:
- The original assignment PDFs
- The "OUTPUT" PDFs that I prepared to show the program results
- The C code solutions that I wrote 

üëâ I hope this repository will be helpful for you!
